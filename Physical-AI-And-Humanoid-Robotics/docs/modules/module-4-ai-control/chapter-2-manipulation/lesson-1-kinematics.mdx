# Kinematics in Robotic Manipulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Calculate forward and inverse kinematics
- Understand robotic arm configurations
- Implement basic manipulation algorithms

## Introduction to Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In robotics, kinematics is crucial for controlling robotic arms and manipulators.

### Forward Kinematics
